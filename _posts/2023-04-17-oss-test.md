Today, We learn about how to make our static website using GitHub pages.

### Step 1. Create Repository for GitHub Pages

Go to GitHub and create new repository.

Set the repository name to '*username*.github.io' and make it public repository.

Check your repository settings.

1. Repository Settings -> Pages
2. Source must be set as "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branche must be set as "None"

And Clone your repository to your Desktop.

### Step 2. Create

Download Jekyll Theme file from [this_website](http://jekllthemes.org).

Unzip downloaded theme file and move all materials to your '*username*.github.io' repository

```bash
$ unzip {downloaded_theme_file}.zip
$ mv {downloaded_theme_file}/* {your_username}.github.io/
```

Add, commit and push to your GitHub repository.

```bash
$ cd {your_username{}.github.io
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first commit"
$ git push origin main
```
After few minutes, you can enter your static website using web browsers (https://*username*.github.io)

### Step 3. Upload new post

In your repository, '_posts' directory will exist.

In '_posts' directory, make new file named '*date*-*title*.md'.

Copy this text into markdown file.

And add, commit, push it!

After few minutes, new posts will be uploaded into your website
